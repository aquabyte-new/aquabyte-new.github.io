Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing any one of our websites (collectively, the “Website”) in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</p><h3>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h3><p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Website, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Website, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Website. In certain</p><h3>Will Aquabyte ever change this Privacy Policy?</h3><p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Website, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on https://www.aquabyte.ai, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Website, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Website after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p><h3>What Information does Aquabyte Collect?</h3><p>Information you provide to us: We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Website through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Website is covered by this Privacy Policy.Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p><p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Website. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by visiting https://www.aquabyte.ai/unsubscribe or emailing us at info@aquabyte.ai.</p><p>Information collected automatically: Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Website, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p><p>Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Website, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p><p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Website – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Website, and we can use that knowledge to make the Website interesting to as many users as possible.</p><p>We use Heap and Google Analytics to help analyze how our users’ use the Website.</p><p>You can opt-out of Heap's automatic retention of data collected through your browsers while on our Website by using the following add-on: https://www.ghostery.com. To track opt-outs, Heap uses a persistent opt-out cookie placed on your devices. If you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter your browser's cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers) you may also clear the Heap opt-out cookie. To learn more about the privacy policy of Heap, visit https://heapanalytics.com/privacy.</p><p>Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often our users visit the Website, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website. We may use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our Website or to send you promotional messages about our Website. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with any personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Website, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Service is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners. Finally, you can opt out of Google Analytics by using the following add-on: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p><p>Information collected from other websites and Do Not Track Policy: Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Website. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Website and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Website does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Website and after you leave our Website.</p><p>Will Aquabyte share any of the Personal Information it receives?</p><p>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p><p>Information that’s been de-identified: We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p><p>Affiliated Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Website profile or to automatically transmit information in your Website profile to your third party account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p><p>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered a “partner” in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of the “Information that’s been de-identified” section in that regard.</p><p>User Profiles and Submissions: Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Website, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website or address your request for our services. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Website and other users can contact you through messages and comments.</p><p>Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p><p>Protection of Aquabyte and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Aquabyte, our employees, our users, or others.</p><h3>Is Personal Information about me secure?</h3><p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p><p>IWe endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p><h3>What Personal Information can I access?</h3><p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete information you’ve provided to us. The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Website changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at info@aquabyte.ai.</p><p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at info@aquabyte.ai.</p><h3>What choices do I have?</h3><p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete information you’ve provided to us. You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p><p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at info@aquabyte.ai. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.</p><h3>What if I have questions about this policy?</h3><p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to info@aquabyte.ai, and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p></div></div></div></section><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"><h3>US Office</h3><ul><li>255 Kansas St, Suite 300 <br>San Francisco, CA 94103<br>United States</li><li> <a href="tel:+14154506050">+1 (415) 450-6050</a></li><li> <a href="mailto:info@aquabyte.ai">info@aquabyte.ai</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"><h3>Norway Office</h3><ul><li>Thormøhlensgate 51<br>Bergen, Hordaland 5006<br>Norway</li><li> <a href="tel:+4756919010">+47 569 19 010 </a></li><li> <a href="mailto:info@aquabyte.no">info@aquabyte.no</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3 col-md-offset-3"><a href="http://www.seafoodinnovation.no/" target="_blank"><img src="/img/NCE.png" class="NCE-badge"></a><div class="social"><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/aquabyteai" target="_blank"><img src="/img/medium.svg"></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/aquabyteai" target="_blank"><img src="/img/twitter.svg"></a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/aquabyteai/" target="_blank"><img src="/img/facebook.svg"></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/18018790/" target="_blank"><img src="/img/linkedin.svg"></a></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="copyright"><p>© 2018 Aquabyte</p><ul><li><a href="#">Login</a></li><li><a href="/terms">Terms</a></li><li><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a></li></ul></div></div></footer>
